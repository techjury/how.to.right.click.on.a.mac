Despite the wealth of two button mice available for use with Macs, the question of how to right click on a Mac or MacBook continues to be asked, so if you aren’t sure how to right-click on a Mac you’re not alone. Years ago Apple famously insisted that a one-button mouse was the way to go, rather than the two-button mouse preferred by Windows users – the legacy of this decision has been a lot of confusion about how to right click on a Mac.

However, we assume that Apple mice aren’t the only reason that the question of how to right click is baffling so many Mac users. Most Mac users are likely to be using laptops without a mouse and are therefore trying to understand how to use Apple’s trackpad, which has no obvious way of indicting a left or right button click – it’s no wonder Mac users are unsure of how to right click on MacBooks. Other users could be unsure because they have moved from a PC to a Mac and aren’t clear about the key combos such as how to cut and paste on a Mac.

* Press control while clicking your mouse
* Press control while clicking the track pad
* If you have an Apple Magic Mouse you can set up a corner for ‘Secondary Click’ in System Preferences
* Press your trackpad with two fingers
* Assign a corner of the trackpad to be a right click
* Use a two button mouse – check out our round up of the best mice for Apple Macs.

## How to right-click with any mouse on a Mac

If you have a non-Apple mouse with two buttons you can simply click the right button. If this doesn’t seem to work, perform a right-click by clicking and holding the Control button on a keyboard.  

Another issue you might encounter with a non-Mac mouse is that it scrolls in the opposite direction. If you find it inconvenient, just change the Scroll direction settings in the Mouse window.
